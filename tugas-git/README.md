# this is my personal website 

my personal website is [mirzaanggara](https://mirza.com). there is contain home, project, and contact 

## Home Section 

on the home section, there are several things that can be seen such as my name, navbar, and a littel information about me.

## Project Section

because there is no project that I have completed yet, in this project section it is still the same as in the home section, but in the **about me** section it changes to **my project**

## Contact Section

In this section of the contact, you can see that there are several ways to contact me, such as Instagram, Gmail, Github, but all available accounts are not personal accounts but special accounts for this project.
